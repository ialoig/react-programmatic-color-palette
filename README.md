## Generate a beautiful color palette

It start generating randomly a base color in the HSL color format.

Then generate a palette of `8 colors`, each with a unique trait:

- `darken` : light value (L of HSL) is incremented by 15%
- `lighter` : light value (L of HSL) is decremented by 15%
- `saturate` : saturation value (S of HSL) is incremented by 15
- `desaturate` : saturation value (S of HSL) is decremented by 15
- `hueRotationPlus` : hue value (H of HSL) is rotated by 90 degree
- `hueRotationMinus` : hue value (H of HSL) is rotated by -90 degree
- `background` : light value (L of HSL) is incremented by 30%
